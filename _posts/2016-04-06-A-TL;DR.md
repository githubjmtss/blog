On the sixth day of April, 1998, I arrived on Earth, with a lot of bawling, puking and hair-pulling. I was born a Tamilian–in Chennai–where I belonged to a hugely pre-installed hierarchical topology of grandparents, parents, uncles, aunties and cousins. So naturally, chicken biriyani and teamwork were priorities.

Chennai was my incubator for roughly a year so I didn’t stay there for too long. My parents moved to Pune for two years where I professionally trained myself to eat, crap, and sleep peacefully. We later moved to Goa for a year of vacation, and to Coimbatore for those two weird years of kindergarten–It wasn’t a co-educational school, *so ewww*.

Wayfaring along the peninsular coast and through the Deccan plateau, I came home after six very long baby years to Bangalore. The weather was cold throughout the year and the people were chill all day, every day. Its bipolar nature could make your bum feel lazy on rainy days and give you spaz attacks during sunny days. There really weren’t–at least to me–any in betweens, however, the vibe was always filled with unfading energy mixed with affection and happiness everywhere throughout all the towns, the layouts, and the hallis.

On my first day of actual school, I was amazed at how chalks worked. They turned from being chalks to powder, leaving behind endless alphabets and numbers ready to be learned. Thanks to the kid who gifted me crayons, I later explored with shapes and colors that turned my emotions into quirky little creatures on paper. I would sometimes stop, reassure myself that I would be an artist one day and continue, leaving behind a dent in the universe.

Oh oh.. and this one day I was like so excited when my mother asked little me which instrument I’d like to take home from the music store one busy evening. I shouted “Definitely, that piano, ma!”— Later that day, my soul heard happiness. I was seven when I brought home my first violin, named piano and since then music has been an important side dish in my plate. It was and still is by far the only form of art where I am perfectly content being a spectator as well as a performer.

I grew up faster than I could ever type ‘Hello, World!’ and sometimes even spent evenings alone in the park wondering why I did not have a sibling yet. But when I met this skinny guy called Rahul Joshi sometime around seventh grade, I didn’t have to worry about it anymore. High school was fun having him and all my bros by my side, besides studying Hindi and you know, high school drama--filled with sycophants--which pushed me down a little bit but things got better over the years and lessons of trust, respect, and friendship were learnt.

Also many more _nice things_ happened…

I moved to the fourth floor where I fell in love with my room and my terrace—Inside I tried electrolysis with pencils, crashed my windows bootloader with linux, built a hackintosh from scratch and procrastinated more on my school assignments. Outside I enjoyed movie marathons with friends, spent time looking up at the elegant night sky together, waited for the ISS to transit by, and wondered why we exist on a cute, pale blue dot. As I grew, I soon discovered that my energy was happier being expended on mathematics, theoretical physics and computational wizardry. Like how “The Starry Night” (painted by Vincent Van Gogh) elevated the background, the night sky to fit perfectly into place with the rest of the painting in the foreground, I took pleasure in the littlest of things that my world could offer me and embraced the beautiful blend of both science and art.

I didn’t stay in Bangalore, either. _fml_. After finishing my tenth grade finals, I looked forward to chill during the long awaited summer break, but shortly after a week, my father’s office got transferred to a tiny island called Bahrain. We packed. I left large chunks of memories behind. And I boldly waved goodbye, hoping that it was only temporary.

All I wanted wa... Arhhg! I can not explain those two years of my life in writing. Two years. Those two years was a metaphor for something that I'm yet to figure out.

Today I guess my childhood is um... over, well legally and I hope not personally. Life’s entropy continues to increase and the more time I spend exploring life, the less I know what to do with said life. My career certainty is also wildly oscillating that you can not compute the derivative of its function at any point. That’s how chaotic it is.

<center><i>So here's to a lifetime minus 18 years of crazy adventures left.</i></center>
