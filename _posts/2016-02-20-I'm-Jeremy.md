I didn’t stay in Chennai for too long. I moved to another beautiful Indian city called Bangalore, where the weather is cold throughout the year and the people are chill all day, every day. On my first day of school, I was amazed at how chalks worked. They turned from being chalks to powder, leaving behind endless alphabets and numbers ready to be learned. Thanks to crayons, I later explored with lines and colors that turned my imagination into quirky little friends on paper. I would sometimes stop, reassure that I would be an artist one day and continue, leaving behind a balance in the universe. Then I grew up faster than I could ever type “Hello, World!” and moved to the fourth floor where I fell in love with my room and my terrace—Inside I tried electrolysis with pencils, crashed my windows bootloader with linux, built a hackintosh from scratch and procrastinated more on my school assignments. Outside I enjoyed movie marathons with friends, spent time looking up at the elegant night sky together, waited for the ISS to transit by, and wondered why we exist on a cute, pale blue dot. Life worked in crazy ways and slowly…I got attached to science. Like how “The Starry Night” (painted by Vincent Van Gogh) elevated the background, the night sky to fit perfectly into place with the rest of the painting in the foreground, I took pleasure in the littlest of things that my world could offer me and embraced the wonderful blend of both arts and science.
