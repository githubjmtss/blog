After my tenth finals, life was assumed to be happier. My lazy motor cortex planned on doing so many happy happy things for the next 104 days and it desperately wanted to explore its interest in weird sounds and acoustic music--boy that stupid thing was na√Øve. However, my dad's office got transferred to an island called Bahrain and I was left with no choice but ARGHHasdfghkl!!

We packed. And then unpacked because I felt the bags were heavier. Packed again because I was wrong and boldly waved goodbye leaving large chunks of memories behind.

Bahrain is a tiny island. Its only 10mi<sup>2</sup>  bigger than Bengaluru---well for now because people here magically turn oceans into land like those Farmville expansions except they're shaped trippy and can only be aesthetically appreciated when seen from a plane! This tiny piece of land also celebrates its own eccentric culture apart from the ubiquitously known stereotypes prevalent among the gulf countries. There aren't much fancier buildings like the Khalifas or the Burjs one finds in Dubai or the draconian laws imposed in the Kingdom next door. _yikes_

I could feel the _gulf_ shortly after landing because a large majority of Malayalees could be seen everywhere and things didn't feel too foreign after all! The very next day, after losing two and a half hours of my life, I was admitted into a fancy DPS school for higher secondary education, in the middle of a term, with forty students in a class who couldn't pronounce my name. I was actually an hour late on my first day of school and a teacher--I later found out that she was our coordinator-- informed me that I was _late_ for a Physics weekly test.
